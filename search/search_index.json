Those parties are responsible to secure their keys by performing rutinely key rotations, even if they are not compromised, and to make other changes in the DID Documents as needed, such as service endpoints. DIDComm has no involvement in that procedure that is particular to each DID method; nevertheless and provided that the DID does not change, the communication can keep flowing normally.</p> <p>However there are cases when the DID (not the DID Document) need to be rotated by one of the parties, such as in the following three cases: 1. At the beginning of a connection: its common that the initial message is in the form of an Out of Band message that it is unencrypted per definition, and may be observed by another party or transmitted in an unsecure channel such as a QR code or a URL posted in an email or webpage. The DID used in the OOB should be considered as a temporal DID just to start the conversation, but it is highly recommended that it is rotated afterwards to improve privacy. 2. When keys inside a DID Document need to be rotated and the DID method does not allow updating the DID Document with new rotated keys, as is the case for did:key. 3. If there is a need to move to a different DID method for whatever reason (security, flexibility, interoperability, etc)</p> <p>DIDComm defines a specific header to handle DID rotation. This header is called <code>from_prior</code> and can be used in any message sent to the other party. That message must include the <code>from_prior</code> header that is a standard JWT token conformed with: - Header:   - <code>typ</code>: <code>jwt</code>   - <code>alg</code>: verification algorithm such as <code>EdDSA</code>   - <code>crv</code>: curve name   - <code>kid</code>: key id from previous DID that is used in the signature of this JWT - Payload:   - <code>sub</code>: the new DID   - <code>iss</code>: the previous DID   - <code>iat</code>: datetime in seconds - Signature: from the previous DID and key defined in the <code>kid</code></p> <p>Once a DIDComm agent receives a message from an unknown DID, it must: 1. check if there\u2019s a <code>from_prior</code> header 2. if exists, extract the DID from the <code>iss</code> and validate if it matches a known DID 3. validate JWT signatures using the key defined in <code>kid</code> and extracted from previous DID defined in <code>iss</code> 4. if all validations are successful, the new DID should be stored for future communications with the previously known agent</p> <p>The sender, who's doing the rotation, should continue to send the rotation header until they receive a message from the other party using the new DID. This allows for continuity even if one party is offline or not processing messages for a while.</p> <p>Example code showing a DID Rotation after an Out of Band message can be found in the section Starting, using and ending a DIDComm connection from this Guidebook.</p> <p>Since DIDComm is asynchronous in nature, messages can arrive in different order. Sender and receiver should take care to: - Sender: avoid starting a DID rotation in the middle of multiple message conversations. If DID rotation arrives out of order, some messages may be discarded by the recipient. - Receiver: messages received from the old DID but after the message that performs the DID rotation must be discarded to reduce the risk of potentially compromised keys.</p> <p>Finally, DID rotation allows a special case when rotating to nothing that denotes the end of the relationship. In this case the DID should be omitted from the <code>from</code> header and from the <code>sub</code> field of the <code>from_prior</code> header.</p>"},{"location":"extensions/","title":"Extensions","text":""},{"location":"extensions/#extensions","title":"Extensions","text":"<p>Extension adds a self-contained set of conventions or features.

It might be tempting to say, \"True. But I'm using https, which gives confidentiality anyway.\" This is a fallacy, because by design a sender in DIDComm doesn't actually know the full route to the target. A sender might be using HTTPS, but perhaps part of the route is not. Using channel-oriented encryption (e.g., TLS) on the part of the channel you can see is not actually secure, if someone somewhere has to take plaintext off that channel and put it somewhere else that you don't know about. The guarantee is supposed to be end-to-end. (In our question #2 above, \"Bob\" is the end; what he does after it gets to him is his business, not DIDComm's. That's why we are comfortable with him using plaintext in a context wholly under his own control.)</p>"},{"location":"faq/#does-using-didcomm-require-rip-and-replace-strategies","title":"Does using DIDComm require rip-and-replace strategies?","text":"<p>This misperception seems to originate from a misunderstanding about how DIDcomm works. </p> <p>Any web server capable of receiving a POST request, and sending a POST request, is capable of sending and receiving encrypted DIDComm messages.

Cryptographic sessions (not to be confused with cookie-based login sessions) may be re-established whenever a socket is re-opened (possibly at intervals only a few seconds apart), or may use techniques like TLS Session Resumption to last for hours or even days.</p> <p>A simple analysis of DIDComm might map PFS \"session keys\" to the ephemeral symmetric keys negotiated by the ECDH-1PU key agreement algorithm; this might imply that the static keys in Alice's DID doc would be the \"long-term keys\" from the PFS definition. In this framing, DIDComm does NOT exhibit PFS, because an attacker that possesses a key from Alice's DID doc can decrypt any old messages sent to that key.</p> <p>But this analysis misses two important insights:</p> <ol> <li> <p>The ephemeral symmetric keys in TLS are two-way and reusable. It makes sense to call them \"session\" keys. In contrast, the ephemeral symmetric keys negotiated by ECDH-1PU in DIDComm are one-way and single-use only. Calling a one-way delivery of a single message a \"session\" seems a bit odd. The natural unit of clustered interaction in DIDComm \u2014 what we use \"sessions\" for in TLS, and what lasts seconds to minutes or hours \u2014 is a single protocol or group of protocols that accomplish one goal for the parties. This is a higher level of abstraction that a single DIDComm message.</p> </li> <li> <p>Only one compromise is contemplated by normal PFS \u2014 the compromise of a single long-term key. But DIDComm is more dynamic. It supports two types of rotation \u2014 rotation of DID doc keys and rotation of DIDs themselves. Moreover, DIDComm supports multiple devices per party, and it encourages the use of pairwise DIDs with a limited lifespan, often not exceeding a single interaction. It is the value of historic communication that makes PFS valuable. If DIDComm throws away DIDs after a single brief interaction, then PFS is irrelevant. If DIDComm rotates DIDs on the same time scales as static key rotation in TLS, then it is a DID's comm history, not Alice's (DID-spanning) comm history, that's endangered by a compromise. And if Alice has a stable DID but updates her DID doc regularly to track an evolving collection of devices, then her vulnerability to long-term key compromise doesn't map very well to the simpler PFS model.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Here are two alternate analyses that suggest DIDComm accomplishes the goals of PFS, even if its approach is unfamiliar. We do NOT advocate these analyses as objectively \"true\" \u2014 they are mutually incompatible, and unless/until formal definitions are satisfied, it is clearly unwise to rely on loose assertions about cryptographic guarantees. Rather, the point of including them here is to illustrate the importance of assumptions. </p>"},{"location":"pfs/#pfs-reframe-1","title":"PFS Reframe 1","text":"<p>In some DIDComm usages, \"sessions\" might have the same scope as DIDs, and \"long-term keys\" might have the same scope as a multi-DID-spanning connection between two parties.

It is true that problems can be communicated in specialized messages of an individual protocol; some protocols may make this choice. However, problems are often the gateway to deeper troubleshooting or even support tickets, which are complex workflows in their own right. Also, robust mechanisms for logging, analyzing, and reacting to problems may be reusable in many workflows. For this reason, it is recommended to model problem reporting as a child protocol, with an arbitrarily complex thread of messages as child to the parent workflow that triggered them.

The exchange of DIDs that occurs via the DID Exchange Protocol used in V1 occurs in each message that is transferred. The important step of rotating DIDs is accomplished via the <code>from_prior</code> header that travels alongside any protocol message. These features make the DID Exchange Protocol redundant.</p> <p>One side effect of the DID Exchange Protocol in V1 was that you confirmed the validity of the DID with a round trip to the other party. Many protocols will provide this assurance via the flow of the protocol prior to the point where round-trip testing is required. When this round-trip is desired prior to the beginning of a protocol, a round trip with another protocol (such as Trust Ping or Feature Discovery) can provide the same assurance.</p>"},{"location":"whatsnew/#special-handling-of-peer-dids-eliminated","title":"Special Handling of Peer DIDs eliminated","text":"<p>DIDComm V1 defined special handling of Peer DIDs, making it very optimized for usage with Peer DIDs. However this made it less obvious how other DID methods could be used with DIDComm. DIDComm V2 eliminated special handling of Peer DIDs, making handling of all DIDs equal from the perspective of the DIDComm spec. This creates a more distinct separation between how DIDs are used (defined by DID Core and specific DID method) and how to securely communicate using DIDs (defined by DIDComm spec).</p> <p>The new <code>to</code> and <code>from</code> attributes inside a DIDComm message allow for query parameters to be included on a DID. Using the query parameters you can exchange additional information without using custom fields. DID methods indicate how query parameters can be used to pass state information. For example, the Peer DID method defines the usage of the <code>initial-state</code> query parameter to pass all information needed to construct a DIDDoc in a single field.</p>"},{"location":"whatsnew/#process-from-headers-prior-to-protocol-processing","title":"Process From Headers prior to Protocol Processing","text":"<p>Relationship changes in V1 were handled inside the DID Exchange Protocol.
